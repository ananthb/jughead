# Jughead - A Hugo theme

Jughead is a minimal and clean theme for hugo with a markdown-ish UI.

## Why Jughead?

I initially forked [archie](https://github.com/athul/archie) to tweak
the colour palette and contrast for better accessibility.

I added comments powered by [utterances](https://utteranc.es),
[MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org) diagram rendering,
reading time indicators, and fixed minor alignment issues.

Then, Hugo Pipes took care of minifying and bundling CSS and JS files.
I removed the option of loading some assets from a CDN.
I also trimmed down the available configuration options for a more opinionated
setup that works out of the box.

### Performance

It preloads important assets, loads JavaScript deferred, and
doesn't load external fonts.
It follows best practices for web performance and accessibility.

### Roadmap

There's some preliminary support for internationalisation, but I have a lot
more to do before I can ship that feature.

I'm also looking to go a different direction visually, now that I'm happy
with how it works under the hood.

## Features

- Reading time indicators
- Comments powered by [utterances](https://utteranc.es)
- [MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org) diagrams
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) & [KaTeX](https://katex.org) rendering
- Auto Dark Mode (based on system theme) with (optional) manual toggle
