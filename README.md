## Roadmap

The project soon snowballed into something bigger.

Here's a list of changes I've made and plan to make:

- [X] Fixed colour contrast
- [X] Added reading time indicators
- [X] Comments with [utterances](https://utteranc.es)
- [X] [MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org) support
- [X] Added auto dark mode
- [X] Simplified configuration
- [X] Improved [performance](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-ananthb-github-io-jughead/wkzm8d6q3x?form_factor=mobile)
- [] i18n support
- [] Improved visual design

## Features

- Reading time indicators
- Comments powered by [utterances](https://utteranc.es)
- [MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org) diagrams
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) & [KaTeX](https://katex.org) rendering
- Auto Dark Mode (based on system theme) with (optional) manual toggle

## Installation

Add jughead to your hugo config files in the modules section.

```toml
[module]
[[module.imports]]
path = 'github.com/ananthb/jughead'

## Writing Posts

Create a new `.md` file in the *content/posts* folder

```yml

Toggle MermaidJS, MathJax, and KaTeX support in your post frontmatter.
Set `mermaid` to `true` to enable MermaidJS support,
`mathjax` to `true` to enable MathJax support,
