## Installation

Add jughead to your hugo config files in the modules section.

```toml
[module]
[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/ananthb/jughead"
```

For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/installation).

## JSON Resume

Render your JSON resume by configuring your unique
[JSON Resume Registry](https://registry.jsonresume.org) slug in the
`params` section of your site configuration file.
The slug is the string that appears after `registry.jsonresume.org/` in your
resume's URL.

```toml
[params]
jsonResumeRegistrySlug = "your-github-username"
```

You can also render a local `resume.json` file by placing it in the
`data` directory of your site.

The local `resume.json` file will take precedence over the JSON Resume Registry.

This will add a basic portfolio section from your resume to your site's
homepage.

You can also render your resume in any page in your site
by creating a new empty page and setting its layout to `resume` in frontmatter.

```markdown
+++
layout = "resume"
date = "2025-01-01"
+++
```

## Write Posts

Use `hugo new posts/my-first-post.md` to create a new post.
Edit the frontmatter and write your post in markdown.

Toggle MermaidJS and KaTeX support in your post frontmatter.
Set `mermaid` to `true` to enable MermaidJS support,
and `katex` to `true` to enable KaTeX support.

```markdown
+++
title = "Diagrams & Equations"
mermaid = true
katex = true
+++
```

MermaidJS and KaTeX are JavaScript heavy.
Enable them when necessary.
